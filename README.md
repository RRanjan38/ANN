# Project Overview
This project leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to segment bank customers based on various behavioral and demographic features. The goal is to predict customer preferences, allowing the bank to implement more effective, data-driven marketing strategies. By training a neural network on historical customer data, the model identifies key patterns and creates distinct customer segments for targeted actions.
